🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading
Imported CSV dataset using Pandas.
Verified schema, data types, and data consistency.

2. Data Cleaning
Checked and handled missing values.
Removed duplicate records.
Standardized categorical values.
Converted columns to appropriate data types.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Customer demographics analysis (age, gender, location).
Purchase amount distribution and spending patterns.
Category-wise and season-wise sales analysis.
Impact of discounts, promo codes, and subscriptions.
Visualization of trends and correlations.

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.
Performed analytical queries such as:
Total and average purchase amount by category
Customer segmentation by purchase frequency
Subscription vs non-subscription behavior
Discount and promo code impact analysis

5. Power BI Dashboard
Designed an interactive dashboard featuring:
Total revenue and average order value
Top-selling categories and items
Customer segmentation insights
Filters by season, location, and gender

6. Reporting & Presentation
Documented insights in a structured report.
Created a professional presentation using Gamma to summarize findings and recommendations.
